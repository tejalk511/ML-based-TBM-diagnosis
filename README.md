# üß† ML-Driven Clinical Decision Support for Tuberculosis Meningitis Diagnosis

## Introduction

Diagnosing Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) and Pyogenic Meningitis (PM) is challenging, especially in resource-limited areas lacking advanced diagnostic tools. This project addresses this challenge by offering a cost-effective diagnostic tool powered by Machine learning and an intuitive web interface to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of TBM and PM in rural settings.

## Overview of the system 

The diagram represents a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), where user input and clinical data are processed by a Diagnostic Model to determine the condition's normality. If abnormal, the Intensity Analyzer evaluates severity, and the system outputs intensity metrics and a graphical representation for user interaction.

## Machine Learning model deployed - 
- The ensemble learning model trains three base models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM (linear)) on the same training set, producing individual predictions.
- The outputs (Prediction 1, 2, and 3) are combined to generate the Final Prediction, improving accuracy and robustness through result aggregation.
