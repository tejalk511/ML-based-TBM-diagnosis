🧠 Meningitis Diagnostic Aid using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Meningitis Diagnostic Aid project! This tool leverages machine learning to assist in diagnosing Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) and Pyogenic Meningitis (PM), especially in areas with limited access to advanced healthcare facilities.

🌟 Introduction
Meningitis can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. However, accurate diagnosis often requires specialized equipment and expertise, which are not always available in resource-limited or rural areas. Our project aims to bridge this gap by providing a simple, cost-effective diagnostic tool using machine learning and a user-friendly web interface.

❓ Problem Statement
Complex Diagnosis: Diagnosing TBM and PM requires specialized tests that may not be accessible in rural or under-resourced areas.
Need for Early Detection: Early diagnosis is vital for effective treatment, but delays are common due to a lack of resources.
Resource Limitations: Many patients suffer because they can't access or afford advanced diagnostic tools.

💡 Solution
Our solution is a machine learning-based diagnostic aid that uses cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory data to differentiate between TBM and PM. We’ve built an interactive web interface using Gradio, allowing healthcare providers to input data and quickly receive a diagnostic output.

📊 Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)
Key Features:
🌐 Interactive Web Interface: Built with Gradio, it’s easy to use for healthcare professionals with minimal training.
🧬 Machine Learning Model: Analyzes CSF data to provide a reliable diagnosis.
📊 Graphical and Textual Output: Presents results visually and with clear text explanations, making the diagnosis easy to understand.
🔍 Input/Output
📝 Input

7 CSF Laboratory Features: Essential data points required for the model to make an accurate diagnosis of meningitis.
📈 Output

Graphical Representation: A graph generated using Matplotlib shows the severity of the condition based on data quartiles.
Textual Summary: A clear summary indicating the level of severity (e.g., Mild, Severe, Highly Severe).


🛠️ Development Tools

Python 3.x: The primary programming language used for developing the system.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical computations and efficient data manipulation.
Matplotlib: Used for creating visualizations to help interpret and present the diagnostic results.
Random Forest: A powerful ensemble learning method used in the model for robust classification and prediction.
Gradient Boosting: Another ensemble technique that enhances model performance through iterative improvement.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Linear: Applied to classify data points effectively for distinguishing between TBM and PM.
